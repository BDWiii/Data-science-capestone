# Data Science Capstone Project

This directory contains a comprehensive set of Jupyter notebooks that walk through the full data science workflow, from data collection and cleaning to advanced analytics and predictive modeling.

## Contents
- **Data Wrangling & Cleaning:** Preparing raw data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and understanding data distributions, relationships, and key features.
- **Visualization:** Creating insightful plots and dashboards (e.g., with Plotly) to communicate findings.
- **Web Scraping & SQL EDA:** Collecting and analyzing data from web sources and databases.
- **Machine Learning & Prediction:**
  - Building, tuning, and evaluating multiple machine learning models, including:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Decision Trees
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Emphasis on hyperparameter tuning (using GridSearchCV) and model selection to ensure robust, reliable predictions.
  - Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.

## Focus on Predictive Modeling
A major focus of this project is leveraging machine learning algorithms to make solid, data-driven predictions. The notebooks guide you through:
- Preparing features and labels for training
- Standardizing and splitting data
- Systematically comparing different ML models
- Selecting the best-performing model for the task
